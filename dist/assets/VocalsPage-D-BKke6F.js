Instead of reaching, straining, or pushing for notes, SLS teaches the intrinsic muscles of the larynx to do the work while the extrinsic muscles (jaw, tongue, neck) stay relaxed. The larynx remains at a neutral, speech-level position — it doesn't rise for high notes or press down for low notes. Over 130 Grammy winners have trained with Seth Riggs using this method, including Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Prince, and Natalie Cole.",keyPoints:["Larynx stays neutral — no rising for high notes, no pressing for low notes","Intrinsic muscles do the work, extrinsic muscles stay relaxed",'Same effort level as speaking — hence "Speech Level"',"130+ Grammy winners trained with Seth Riggs","Works for ALL genres — pop, rock, R&B, opera, musical theater"]},{title:"Vocal Registers & Bridges",content:'Every voice has distinct registers: chest voice (lower, speaking range), mix voice (middle, blended), and head voice (upper, lighter quality). Between these registers are "bridges" (also called passaggi) — transition points where the vocal cords must change their configuration. For most male voices, the first bridge is around E4-F#4. SLS exercises like NAY, MUM, and GUG are specifically designed to train smooth transitions through these bridges, eliminating the "crack" or "flip" that untrained voices experience.',keyPoints:["Three main registers: Chest, Mix, and Head voice","Male first bridge (passaggio): E4 to F#4","NAY exercise finds mix voice through pharyngeal resonance","MUM/GUG train cord closure through bridges","The goal: seamless transitions, no flips or cracks","Mix voice is NOT falsetto — it's connected, blended tone"]},{title:"Why SLS Works for Rock",content:`Rock singing demands power, grit, and endurance — exactly what SLS delivers through efficiency rather than force. Resonance efficiency (mask placement, twang) gives you volume without pushing. False fold distortion provides rock texture without true cord abuse.

Steven Tyler, Bon Jovi, Bono, and Robert Plant all use SLS principles — they've maintained their voices over decades of touring because their technique is efficient, not forceful.`,keyPoints:["Power through resonance efficiency, not force","False fold distortion for rock grit — NOT true cord abuse","Thyroid tilt mechanism for sustainable belting","Steven Tyler, Bono, Robert Plant use SLS principles","Vocal longevity through technique, not talent alone","Mix voice is the rock singer's secret weapon"]},{title:"The Diaphragm Connection",content:'The diaphragm is the engine of singing.

This creates steady, minimal pressure airflow. Think of it like a car engine: you want smooth, consistent power delivery, not a series of explosions. The goal is minimal, steady pressure that lets the cords do their job. Too much air pressure forces the cords to resist, leading to strain, fatigue, and damage.',keyPoints:["Appoggio: balanced opposition between inhale and exhale muscles","Minimal, steady pressure — not maximum air volume","Too much air = cord strain.
