    title: 'What Is Speech Level Singing?',
    content: 'Speech Level Singing (SLS) is a vocal technique developed by Seth Riggs that trains singers to use the same comfortable, speech-level effort throughout their entire range. Instead of reaching, straining, or pushing for notes, SLS teaches the intrinsic muscles of the larynx to do the work while the extrinsic muscles (jaw, tongue, neck) stay relaxed. The larynx remains at a neutral, speech-level position — it doesn\'t rise for high notes or press down for low notes. Over 130 Grammy winners have trained with Seth Riggs using this method, including Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Prince, and Natalie Cole.',
    keyPoints: [
      'Larynx stays neutral — no rising for high notes, no pressing for low notes',
      'Intrinsic muscles do the work, extrinsic muscles stay relaxed',
      'Same effort level as speaking — hence "Speech Level"',
      '130+ Grammy winners trained with Seth Riggs',
      'Works for ALL genres — pop, rock, R&B, opera, musical theater',
    ],
  },
  {
    title: 'Vocal Registers & Bridges',
    content: 'Every voice has distinct registers: chest voice (lower, speaking range), mix voice (middle, blended), and head voice (upper, lighter quality). Between these registers are "bridges" (also called passaggi) — transition points where the vocal cords must change their configuration. For most male voices, the first bridge is around E4-F#4. SLS exercises like NAY, MUM, and GUG are specifically designed to train smooth transitions through these bridges, eliminating the "crack" or "flip" that untrained voices experience.',
    keyPoints: [
      'Three main registers: Chest, Mix, and Head voice',
      'Male first bridge (passaggio): E4 to F#4',
      'NAY exercise finds mix voice through pharyngeal resonance',

      'The goal: seamless transitions, no flips or cracks',
      'Mix voice is NOT falsetto — it\'s connected, blended tone',
    ],
  },
  {
    title: 'Why SLS Works for Rock',
    content: 'Rock singing demands power, grit, and endurance — exactly what SLS delivers through efficiency rather than force. Resonance efficiency (mask placement, twang) gives you volume without pushing. False fold distortion provides rock texture without true cord abuse. The thyroid tilt mechanism (trained through NAY and bratty exercises) creates the "belt" sound sustainably. Steven Tyler, Bon Jovi, Bono, and Robert Plant all use SLS principles — they\'ve maintained their voices over decades of touring because their technique is efficient, not forceful.',

    ],
  },
  {
    title: 'The Diaphragm Connection',
    content: 'The diaphragm is the engine of singing. SLS uses the "appoggio" technique — a balanced opposition between the inhalation muscles (which want to expand) and the exhalation muscles (which want to compress). This creates steady, minimal pressure airflow. Think of it like a car engine: you want smooth, consistent power delivery, not a series of explosions. The goal is minimal, steady pressure that lets the cords do their job. Too much air pressure forces the cords to resist, leading to strain, fatigue, and damage.',

    title: 'Daily Practice Philosophy',
    content: 'Seth Riggs recommends 20-30 minutes of focused practice daily rather than long, exhausting sessions. Quality over quantity. The golden rule: if it hurts, stop. Discomfort means you\'re doing it wrong. Vocal cords are tiny muscles — they fatigue faster than your biceps. Build gradually: 15 minutes for beginners, working up to 30 minutes. Expect noticeable improvement in 6-12 weeks with consistent practice. Record yourself — your ears inside your head hear a different voice than the audience.',
